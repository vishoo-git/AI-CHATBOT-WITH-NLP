DESCRIPTION:

Project: Chatbot Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a basic chatbot using NLP techniques, which can understand and respond to user queries in natural language. Using libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), the chatbot will be able to process user input, detect patterns, and generate appropriate responses based on predefined rules. The chatbot will be able to answer simple questions, engage in casual conversation, and help with specific queries.

Key Features:
Pattern Recognition: The chatbot recognizes user queries based on predefined patterns and responds with suitable replies.
Conversational Flow: The bot simulates a conversation by responding to greetings, inquiries about its name, and questions about how itâ€™s doing.
Flexibility: The chatbot uses regular expressions to identify patterns in user input, making it adaptable to various forms of similar queries.
Exit Mechanism: The bot can exit the conversation when the user types "quit" or "exit".
Project Components:
NLTK Library:

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is used to implement basic NLP functions such as tokenization and pattern matching.
The Chat class from NLTK provides a simple framework for creating rule-based chatbots by matching user input to predefined patterns and generating appropriate responses.
Pattern Matching:

The chatbot is powered by predefined patterns and associated responses. For example, if the user greets the bot with "Hello" or "Hi," the bot will respond with a friendly greeting like "Hello! How can I assist you today?".
Regular expressions (regex) are used to identify keywords and phrases in user input, making the chatbot more flexible and capable of handling a variety of query formats.
User Interaction:

The chatbot keeps the conversation going until the user types "quit" or "exit."
It recognizes common phrases such as greetings, requests for help, or general questions about itself (e.g., "What is your name?").
